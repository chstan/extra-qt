Development Plans
=================

This is not a timeline, unless there are other users or
contributors, when and if something gets built depends
on when it is urgently needed.

Long term I might port this to Rust as a way of learning
Rust better and to provide bindings to other languages.

For now there are some easier things to do:

1. Improve fidelity to the React stack reconciler
2. Add key support
3. Add support for children moves

Qt Specific
-----------

1. Improve the relationship between Tabs and children
2. Support more signals
3. Stronger typing for Styles
4. Modal/QDialog
5. Support custom QWidget types

General
-------

1. Write a ``dict`` renderer for testing
2. Tests
